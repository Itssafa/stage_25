# Manufacturing Production Management System - Completion Plan

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack manufacturing production management system with Spring Boot backend and Angular frontend. The system manages production orders, manufacturing operations, worker assignments, and quality control parameters.

## Current Status Analysis

### ✅ Backend (Spring Boot) - 85% Complete
**Completed:**
- Complete entity model (9 entities: User, OrdreFab, Produit, LigneProduction, Operation, Poste, Affectation, Parametre, Application)
- Full CRUD controllers for all entities (12 controllers)
- Service layer implementation
- Repository layer with JPA
- JWT authentication & security configuration
- Role-based access control with custom annotations
- Database configuration (MySQL)
- Input validation with Bean Validation

**Missing/Incomplete:**
- Entity relationships may need getters/setters/constructors (Lombok not fully implemented)
- DTOs for complex operations
- Advanced business logic in services
- Error handling and exception management
- API documentation (Swagger)
- Unit and integration tests

### ⚠️ Frontend (Angular) - 40% Complete
**Completed:**
- Basic project structure with Angular 16
- Authentication components (Login/Register)
- JWT interceptor and auth guard
- Basic routing configuration
- User model and auth service
- Basic dashboard and profile components

**Missing:**
- Manufacturing-specific components (Orders, Products, Production Lines, etc.)
- Complete UI for all backend entities
- Data services for each entity
- Forms for CRUD operations
- Advanced routing and navigation
- Material Design implementation
- State management
- Error handling and loading states

## Priority Tasks (Immediate - Next 2 weeks)

### High Priority
1. **Fix Entity Classes** - Add missing Lombok annotations or manual getters/setters
2. **Complete User Management** - Finish admin user management functionality
3. **Implement Core Manufacturing Components** - Orders, Products, Production Lines
4. **Database Schema Validation** - Ensure all relationships work correctly

### Medium Priority
1. **Error Handling** - Both backend and frontend
2. **Form Validation** - Complete validation for all forms
3. **Navigation** - Implement complete navigation system
4. **Authentication Edge Cases** - Handle token expiration, refresh tokens

### Low Priority
1. **UI Polish** - Material Design theming
2. **Performance Optimization** - Lazy loading, caching
3. **Advanced Features** - Charts, reports, exports

## Technical Debt to Address
1. **Code Consistency** - Standardize naming conventions across backend and frontend
2. **Security** - Review and harden security configurations
